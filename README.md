# DisplayXR Unity Test Project — 2D UI Overlay Variant

A URP test project that exercises the **window-space 2D UI overlay** feature
of the [DisplayXR Unity plugin](https://github.com/DisplayXR/displayxr-unity)
(`DisplayXRWindowSpaceUI`, plumbed through `XrCompositionLayerWindowSpaceEXT`
in the OpenXR runtime).

The scene renders a textured cube on a tracked 3D display and overlays a
runtime-built UI panel (IPD slider, virtual-display-height slider,
render-mode cycle button) submitted as a window-space composition layer.

**Render pipeline:** Universal (URP).

**Sibling test projects** — each repo focuses on one feature so a regression
in one demo doesn't mask the others:

| Repo | What it demonstrates | Pipeline |
|---|---|---|
| [displayxr-unity-test](https://github.com/DisplayXR/displayxr-unity-test) | Display-centric vs camera-centric rigs, live rig switching | BiRP |
| [displayxr-unity-test-2d-ui](https://github.com/DisplayXR/displayxr-unity-test-2d-ui) (you are here) | `XrCompositionLayerWindowSpaceEXT` 2D UI overlay (`DisplayXRWindowSpaceUI`) | URP |
| [displayxr-unity-test-transparent](https://github.com/DisplayXR/displayxr-unity-test-transparent) | Chroma-key transparent overlay (`DisplayXRTransparentOverlay`, Windows-only) | BiRP |

## Requirements

- **Unity 6000.3 LTS** (Unity 6) or newer
- A spatial display supported by [DisplayXR](https://github.com/DisplayXR/displayxr-runtime), or use the built-in `sim_display` driver for development without hardware
- The DisplayXR runtime installed (via the [installer](https://github.com/DisplayXR/displayxr-shell-releases/releases))

## Opening the Project

1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DisplayXR/displayxr-unity-test-2d-ui.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Unity Hub (`File → Open Project`)
3. Unity will fetch dependencies — this may take a few minutes on first open
4. Open `Assets/CubeTest.unity` to load the test scene

### URP setup

The project ships with the Universal Render Pipeline package in its manifest.
On first import, `Assets/Editor/URPSetupBootstrap.cs` automatically creates an
XR-friendly URP pipeline asset (`Assets/Settings/URP-Pipeline.asset` with
`UpscalingFilter=Auto`, MSAA off — both required to keep the OpenXR project
validator happy) and assigns it to Project Settings → Graphics + Quality.

If the cube renders magenta on first open, the wood-crate material is still
referencing the Built-in `Standard` shader. Run the URP converter once to
upgrade materials:

1. `Window → Rendering → Render Pipeline Converter`
2. Choose **Built-in to URP**
3. Tick *Material and Material Reference Upgrade*, then *Initialize Converters*
   and *Convert Assets*

## Plugin Reference

The project depends on the DisplayXR Unity plugin via Unity Package Manager. The dependency is declared in `Packages/manifest.json`:

```json
"com.displayxr.unity": "https://github.com/DisplayXR/displayxr-unity.git#upm/v1.2.9"
```

To test against a different plugin version, edit the URL fragment (`#upm/v1.2.9`) to point at the desired tag, then run `Window → Package Manager → Refresh`.

To test against a local development build of the plugin, change the dependency to:
```json
"com.displayxr.unity": "file:/absolute/path/to/displayxr-unity"
```

## Test Scene

| Scene | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `Assets/CubeTest.unity` | Rotating textured cube on a tracked 3D display + a runtime-built window-space UI panel: IPD slider, virtual-display-height slider, render-mode cycle button. Verifies basic rendering AND the `XrCompositionLayerWindowSpaceEXT` overlay path. |

The window-space UI is constructed at runtime by `Assets/Scripts/DisplayXRTuningUI.cs` (programmatic Canvas + sliders + button — no hand-authored UI prefab). Adjust `panelX/panelY/panelWidth/panelHeight` on the `DisplayXR_TuningUI` GameObject to reposition the panel inside the runtime window.

### Known limitation: read-only UI

`XrCompositionLayerWindowSpaceEXT` submits pixels; it doesn't carry input.
The plugin renders `DisplayXRWindowSpaceUI` content via a private WorldSpace
canvas + dedicated camera, which is invisible to Unity's screen-space mouse
raycasts — so sliders and buttons display correctly but **don't currently
respond to clicks**. An input router that maps runtime-window mouse coords
back to canvas-local events is tracked as a v1.2.10+ follow-up. For
interactive UI today, render the canvas through your `DisplayXRDisplay` rig
instead (LeiaInc-style); window-space layers are best for read-only HUDs.

## Running the Project

1. With a spatial display connected: Press Play in the Unity Editor — the scene will render with stereo 3D and head tracking
2. Without hardware: The DisplayXR runtime's `sim_display` driver activates automatically — use WASD + mouse to simulate eye movement
3. To build a standalone player: `File → Build Settings → Build`
